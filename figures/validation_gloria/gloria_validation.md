This document presents the validation of different GLO-RIA measurments. Twoa pproaches were chosen for the validation. First, we compared some of the measurements from GLO-RIA with manual ones (for the directionality). Second, we used the ArchiSimple model (Pagès et al. 2013) to generated images of root systems. Since the images are created using a model, we know the ground-truth values for each of them. This allows us to validate GLORIA on a large number of ground-truth images.




# Size related measurements

 



For the validation of size variables, we used Archisimple to generate 1050 root systems with contrasted size. We compared the results from GLO-RIA with the ground-truth values from the model.

# Directionality



For the validation of directionality measurements, we used Archisimple to generate 1050 root systems with contrasted gravitropism. We compared the results from GLO-RIA with the ground-truth values from the model.
